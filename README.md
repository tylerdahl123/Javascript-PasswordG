# Javascript-PasswordG
# Your Project Title

## Description 

For this project I was tasked with completing a random passowrd generator. The application requires user input that will then be used to create a password that fits within the parameters.
The app runs in google chrome using prompts in javascript to allow the user to fill in the criteria. By using javascript and conditional logic the application will be able to tell the user a passoword no shorter then 8 and no longer than 128 characters.
I used if and while statements to be able to control the overall logic of the application. I also made user of Javascript functions and nesting fucntions within functions to be able to get the desired result.
I also used some for loops to create random numbers.
I also used some dom elements to be able to pick out pieces of the html and assign them new values.



## Installation

All you really need is an up to date web browser.


## Usage 
the app allows the user to be able to generate a random password based on certain criteria.
